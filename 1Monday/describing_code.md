Describing code in an interview
--------------------------------

Either: 
* Something already wrote
* Something you have write on the spot

RELAX.........
----------------------------------
Pretend I already have the job.
Interview is just a coworker that came to me for help

Puts you in a helping teaching mindset

Changes things to be a bit more "cooperative"
    Employers love teamwork

Don't be afraid to explore the problem
    Think out loud!


Teach the problem to the interviewer
-----------------------------------------
UPER!

Understand: 
    Explain the problem to the interviewer
        In your own words

Plan:
    If you already wrote the code:
        Compare multiple solutions that you came up with
    Else:
        Come up with multiple solutions 
        Choose one of them

Execute:
    If you already wrote the code:
        Go over the code you wrote
    Else:
        Implement the code


Reflect
    If you already wrote the code: 
        If you thought of anything else to improve it, share it. 
        Come up with future improvements
